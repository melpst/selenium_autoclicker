# auto-clicker
This project has been created due to my mom's easier life (and yes for my educational purpose also).

This project can be used to play episodes in series continuously in fullscreen mode (on a specific website, since html code in each website wouldn't be exactly the same).

Also it can skip intro, outro of each episode but this part needs to be tune in every series.

## Getting Started
Note that, this project requires python3 (version 3.12.2) and virtualenv (which usually comes along with python3.3 or later)

1. Clone this repository to wherever you want
2. Go to that directory, then use this command to create virtualenv

    `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Then use below command to download required libs
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Next, you have to set value in `.env` file
5. Now, you are ready to run the code!

## How to use?
Just simply run `python auto_clicket.py`
